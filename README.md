*Play* with the app by adding a few items, checking-off and toggling the views in the footer.

### Todo List *Basic* Functionality

A todo list has only 2 *basic* functions:

1. **Add** a `new` item to the list (when the **`[Enter]`** key is pressed)
2. **Check-off** an item as " **completed** " ( *done/finished* )

> **Add** item and " **Check-off** " is *exactly* the "functionality" you would have in a  *paper* -based Todo List.

#### "Advanced" Functionality

In *addition* to these basic functions, **Todo** has the ability to:

* **Un-check** an item as to make it " **active** " ( *still to be done* )
* **Double-click/tap** on todo **item description** to  **`edit` it** .
* **Mark *all* as complete**
* **Click `X`** on item row to remove from list.

#### `<footer>` Menu

below the main interface there is a `<footer>` with a  **count** , **3 view toggles** and  **one action** : 

* Items count
* Show **`All`**
* Show **`Active`**
* Show **`Completed`**
* ***Clear* `Completed`**
